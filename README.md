## Game Rules

1. The game consists of 9 small tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3Ã—3 grid
2. After the first move, each move forces the opponent to play in the corresponding sub-board
3. If a sub-board is won or filled, it's marked and no more moves can be played there
4. If sent to a completed board, players can choose any available board
5. Win by getting three sub-boards in a row on the main grid

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)

## Technical Details

### Frontend (Next.js)
- React hooks for state management
- Socket.IO client for real-time communication
- Canvas-based particle animation
- CSS Grid for responsive game board layout

### Backend (Socket.IO)
- Room-based game sessions
- Real-time move synchronization
- Game state validation
- Player role management

### Game Logic
- Ultimate Tic Tac Toe rule enforcement
- Sub-board win detection
- Turn management
- Active board highlighting

## Customization

### Styling
- Modify `styles/globals.css` for visual changes
- Particle effects can be customized in `components/ParticleBackground.js`
- Color scheme uses CSS custom properties for easy theming

### Game Rules
- Server-side game logic is in the `GameRoom` class in `server.js`
- Client-side validation in `components/GameBoard.js`

## Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel/Netlify)
1. Build the Next.js app: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `out` folder to your hosting service

### Backend (Heroku/Railway)
1. Deploy `server.js` to your Node.js hosting service
2. Update the Socket.IO URL in `pages/room/[roomId].js`

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure both frontend (3000) and backend (3001) are running
- **Room Not Found**: Check that the room ID is correct and the server is running
- **Moves Not Working**: Verify you're assigned as a player and it's your turn
